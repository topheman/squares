TOPHEMAN SQUARES
================

##Intro##
This is a game I made in 2011, the repository was previously on googlecode : https://code.google.com/p/topheman-squares/

## What is Topheman Squares ? ##
An adaptation in HTML5/Javascript - based on the memories I have, of a game I used to play in the 90s on our IIvi (our first color computer).

## How to play Topheman Squares ? ##
* To get to the next level, you have to cover at least 80% of the game zone or kill every enemies.
* To kill an enemy, you have to get an orange dot that appears from time to time.
* The bigger shapes you draw, the higher score you get.

## Why HTML5/Javascript ? ##
I really enjoy coding in Javascript and that was the occasion of using the canvas feature of html5.
## Requirements ##
All you need is a recent browser. Here's a list of the OS / browsers I've tested the game on :

* Windows : Chrome 16, Firefox 3.6.25, Safari 5.1.2
* Mac : Firefox
* Linux :
  * Ubuntu 11.04 : Chrome 14, Rekonq 0.7.0, FireFox 4
Report any bug or inconsistencies to help improve the game. You can mail me or leave a comment on this blog post.
